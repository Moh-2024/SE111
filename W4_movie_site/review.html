            <!--5-7 sentence review-->
            <p><i>Avengers: Infinity War</i> is an epic superhero movie that brings together all the fan favorite Marvel characters
            in a battle against one of the powerful villans, Thanos. The movie is filled with intense action sequences, with amazing visual
        effects.What I loved most about the movie is the way it balanced different characters and their own storylines. Each superhero had their moment
    to shine. The emotional moments where the heroes lose one and scrafice their life to fight and stop thanos. Overall,<i>Avengers Infinity War</i> has everything
you ask for in a super hero movie.  </p>

                <h3>Trivia for <em>Empire Records</em></h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tom Holland was not allowed to read the script for this movie, since he revealed too many secrets for
                         Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). In one of the promotional videos for the movie, several of its cast members are in an 
                         interrogation room refusing to reveal any spoilers, and Holland's mouth is conspicuously taped shut.</li>
                    <li>Doctor Strange has been studying for a few years since his solo movie, and is now considered one of the more powerful characters 
                        in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The writers also wanted to have him come off as sort of "the adult in the room" throughout the movie.</li>
                    <li>Mark Ruffalo revealed that he was given a fake script due to his habit of accidentally spoiling past Marvel movies.
                         He jokingly claimed in an interview that the fake script was better than the real one.</li>
